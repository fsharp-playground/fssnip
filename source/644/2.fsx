/// These are F# solutions of Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems 
/// (http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems), 
/// which are themselves translations of Ninety-Nine Lisp Problems
/// (http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2006s2/funcional/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html)
/// and Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems
/// (https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems).
///
/// If you would like to contribute a solution or fix any bugs, send 
/// an email to paks at kitiara dot org with the subject "99 F# problems". 
/// I'll try to update the problem as soon as possible.
///
/// The problems have different levels of difficulty. Those marked with a single asterisk (*) 
/// are easy. If you have successfully solved the preceeding problems you should be able to 
/// solve them within a few (say 15) minutes. Problems marked with two asterisks (**) are of 
/// intermediate difficulty. If you are a skilled F# programmer it shouldn't take you more than 
/// 30-90 minutes to solve them. Problems marked with three asterisks (***) are more difficult. 
/// You may need more time (i.e. a few hours or more) to find a good solution
///
/// Though the problems number from 1 to 99, there are some gaps and some additions marked with 
/// letters. There are actually only 88 problems.
